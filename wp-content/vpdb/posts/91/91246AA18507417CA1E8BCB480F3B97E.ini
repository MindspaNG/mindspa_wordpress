<p>Poor nutrition is not the sole cause of mental illness. Lack of essential nutrients has been known to contribute to the onset of poor mental health in people suffering from anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and ADHD. Here are some things that should be included in your diet;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>1. Carbohydrates and eating regularly</em></strong>; 20% of the energy needed by the body is used by the brain. This energy comes from blood glucose in the carbohydrates we eat. When there isn’t enough energy for the brain, we may feel weak, tired and unable to think clearly.<br>Some <strong><em>sources</em></strong> of carbohydrates include legumes, wholegrain, vegetables, lower-fat dairy, fruits</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em><strong><em>2. Protein and fat</em></strong>ty acids; </em></strong><em>The brain also needs amino acids to regulate thoughts and feelings. Protein is a source of amino acid, so it is important to take enough of it.</em><br><em><strong>Protein Sources</strong> include fish, lean meat, cheese, soya products, legumes, eggs, nuts and seeds</em><br><em><strong>Fatty acids</strong> like omega-3 and omega-6 are also essential for our brains to function well.</em> <em>Healthy fats can be gotten from nuts, oily fish, poultry, avocados, dairy products, eggs and seeds.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>3. Vitamins and minerals;</em></strong> Different vitamin/mineral deficiencies can affect mood in different ways -<br>a. Lack of<strong><em> iron</em></strong> could lead to feeling weak, tired and lethargic.<br><strong><em>Sources</em></strong> are red meat, poultry, beans, fish, and fortified cereals.<br>b.  Deficiency of <strong><em>B vitamins</em></strong> can make you feel tired, low and irritable.<br><strong><em>Sources </em></strong>are animal protein and fortified cereals.<br>c.<strong><em> Folate (Vitamin B-9)</em></strong> deficiency may put you at a higher risk of feeling depressed. It can be <strong><em>found</em></strong> in green vegetables, liver, beans, citrus fruits and fortified foods like marmite.<br>d. <strong><em>Selenium</em></strong> deficiency may increase chances of feeling depressed and other negative mood states. Sources are fish, meat, wholemeal bread, brazil nuts and seeds.</p>
